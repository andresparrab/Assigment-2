                           <p>late 1960 ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency)
                              started its first test with computer in UCLA and another in Stanford, Sudents from UCLA could access the database from Stanford. After successfull testing they expanded the amount of computers connected and 1974 there was 5o connected computers ARPANET was  online. But it was a close network.
                           </p>
                           <p>1973 started the development of internetworking or connecting multiple networks. and with that ame the tcp/ip protocoll .
                              Then cams USENET AND Telnet, and here things tarted to get faster and interesting, even email.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              1994 there was around 3000 webpages, and two year later there was around 2.5 million websites, and from there it grow to the amazon internet that there is today.
                           </p>
                           <p>Now everything is connected, smart tvs , mobile phones, cars, buses, i would say almost everything in our lives are in one way or another connected to the internet.
                              like lights in the home yo can turn of with the phone or  coffemachine, and even toothbrush, send data over the internet so you can see that data in a nice graph how you bursh our teeths.
                           </p>
                           <p>In the futue it is estimate that the amount of internet connected devices will reach  75 billion. And a new technoogi called Li-Fi will eventually replace wifi. it can transfer 225 gigabytes per second</p>

                        <br>
                        <h4>
                           <p>
                              Well, what can i say here, internet is a part of almost everything. And it has a big impact in society.</p>
                                <p>
                              to answer this questions. I will talk about an own example from my own experience.
                            
                              I have made my whole home like a smart home. for example when I am five minutes from getting home, google will know this by getting my GPS location and start the coffee machine. So when I arrive home I am welcome with a pleasant coffee smell.
                              When I go to sleep I say goodnight and the tv in the living room, speakers and everything will turn off. Then ask me for what time to set the alarm for the next day.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                              When I run I also use run keeper app for track my speed, calories etc.
                              And the apps want me to stay on track if I miss running some days, or that now that I have run so many km then I should buy Asics tuning shoes...etc</p>
                              <p>
                              But in this case I am aware of how the people that program the sites try to to make me buy this brand shoes or guilt-trip me if I dint run enough this week or not burn enough calories and  I can see how they want some some kind of control of my life. And because this awareness I dont live and breathe about what my running app tells me to do, or what netflix suggest me to watch or what product I is the perfect for me, or what news to see. Of course I dont say I dont follow any suggestions or so in the apps, or browser or computer. But I am aware of what company want with this website, if the product of this free site/app is ME (because nothing is really free, and a lot of information about me my integrity get passed around) and then I try to make an informed decisions. Do I still fall into traps that the internet companies want me to? sure, I am only human.
                              </p>
                              <p>	
                              It is very important to have awareness about internet and that you how they program devices, apps and websites and what they really want us to do and be critic. Also is important to know that we can change the thing in internet , they are not almighty and that WE can change what information we want or not by taking action and have a voice out there.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                              The examples above are just  few things.. there are devices connectet to the internet everywhere around us. from smart watches, toothbrushes with a.i that suggest you how to brush your teeth, smart lights, of course computers and phones, smart tv:s that always can show you what you should see. weight scales, that can tell you body fat(not accurate) weight, pulse etc, send this to your phone and then show you your progress or opposite. The list are endless.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                              David Lazer, professor of political science and computer and information science at Northeastern University explain very well in this video about how is the democracy today with fake news, social networks and algorithms.
                              https://www.cornell.edu/video/democracy-today-fake-news-social-networks-algorithms
                              just one example of many in this video is the rise of synergistic (parasitic) system: the meta mediators. Like how we  find out about the world via mediators, google, facebook or twitter to name a few because we are not really experiencing it our self's for example what happens in Iran, syria etc.  And in this way they can have power of how and what we get for info... Because for example google controls whats going to show in the first few pages in a search, people almost never go to the search result page 30 to look for info. Because we think that the most relevant info is maybe the first or second page. And let me tell you  it is absolutely not true. I have a friend that works in this area in google to make algorithms about what should be shown or not show in the search result.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                              Another example is facebook. It have a system to  choose to show a post from this friend or this friend but now from this other friend.
